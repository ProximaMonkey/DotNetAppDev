ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 43, WebHooks and SignalR

The sample code for this chapter contains these solutions:
- SignalRSample
- WebHooksSample

The sample code of this chapter is using the .NET Framework because SignalR and WebHooks was not available for .NET Core at the time writing this book. However, the WPF application makes use of a .NET Core library for dependency injection. This is currently based on .NET Core RC1. 

When .NET Core RC2 is available, samples from this Chapter will be changed.
Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently,
8-Apr is planned for RC2
30-Jun is planned for RTM of .NET Core.
Please check this link for Microsoft's actual schedule:

After the release of .NET Core it is expected that updates for SignalR and WebHooks follow. Please check the github site for additional samples: https://github.com/ProfessionalCSharp/ProfessionalCSharp6

Thank you!
