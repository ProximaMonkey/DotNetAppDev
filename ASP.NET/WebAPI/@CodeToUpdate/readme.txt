The sample code for this chapter contains this solution:
- BooksServiceSample

An OData sample will be added when RC2 is available.

The version you downloaded is built using ASP.NET 5 RC1. The NuGet packages, namespaces, and a few code lines will change when RC2 is available.

You need to install the ASP.NET 5 tools in addtion to Visual Studio 2015. 
Install the tools from here:
https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=627627

After opening the files from Visual Studio, you might need to start the command prompt and download the necessary NuGet packages using
>dnu restore

If you have the .NET Core Command Line (CLI) Tools installed, you can use
>dotnet restore
instead.

Please download and install the .NET Core Command Line (CLI) Tools from https://github.com/dotnet/cli. For Windows, you will find an MSI package that you can install on your Windows system: https://dotnetcli.blob.core.windows.net/dotnet/beta/Installers/Latest/dotnet-win-x64.latest.exe 

When .NET Core RC2 is available, samples from this Chapter will be changed.
Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently this are Microsoft's plans for RC2 and RTM:
8-Apr-2016 - RC2
30-Jun-2016 - RTM
