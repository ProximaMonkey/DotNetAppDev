ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 44, Windows Communication Foundation

The sample code for this chapter contains these solutions:
- DuplexCommunication
- RoomReservation
- RoutingSample
- WebSocketSample

The sample code of this chapter is using the .NET Framework because WCF (the server part) is not available with .NET Core.
The RoomReservation sample makes use of a database that is accessed using Entity Framework Core. With the current download, this is based .NET Core RC1. 

When .NET Core RC2 is available, samples from this Chapter will be changed.
Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently,
8-Apr is planned for RC2
30-Jun is planned for RTM of .NET Core.
Please check this link for Microsoft's actual schedule:
