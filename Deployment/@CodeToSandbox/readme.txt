ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 45, Deploying Websites and Services

The sample code for this chapter contains these solutions:
- WebDotnetCore
- WebDotnetFramework

The sample code for WebDotnetFramework is based on the .NET Framework. The sample code of the solution WebDotnetCore is based on .NET Core RC1. The code of this project will be changed when RC2 is available. You can also easily create these solutions from the Visual Studio templates for ASP.NET Web Application (MVC).

When .NET Core RC2 is available, samples from this Chapter will be changed.
Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently,
8-Apr is planned for RC2
30-Jun is planned for RTM of .NET Core.
Please check this link for Microsoft's actual schedule:
