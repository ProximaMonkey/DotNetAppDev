ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 18, .NET Compiler Platform

The sample code for this chapter contains one solution with several projects. If you open the solution with Visual Studio 2015, you can see the projects grouped into
- Refactoring
- Semantics
- Syntax Analysis
- Transformation

For some of the projects you need to install Visual Studio SDK. This option can be selected when installing Visual Studio 2015, and you can change this later as shown here:

Some of the projects make use of .NET Core packages. These will be updated as RC2 and RTM of .NET Core becomes available.

Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently,
8-Apr is planned for RC2
