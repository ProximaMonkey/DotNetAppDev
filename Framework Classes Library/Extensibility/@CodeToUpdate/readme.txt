ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 26, Composition

The sample code for this chapter contains these solutions:
- AttributeBasedSample
- ConventionBasedSample
- UICalculator (WPF)

To run the applications, you need to create a directory c:/AddIns. With post-build commands, add-in libraries are copied to this directory. To use a different directory, please change the post build command and the directory defined in the hosting application.

The applications make use of MEF 2 and portable libraries. As composition becomes available with .NET Core (it's planned for RTM), the projects will be updated and changed to .NET Core libraries instead of portable libraries.

Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.

Currently,
8-Apr is planned for RC2
30-Jun is planned for RTM of .NET Core.
