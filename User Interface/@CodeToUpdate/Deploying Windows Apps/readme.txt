ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 36, Deploying Windows Apps

The sample code for this chapter contains two solutions. One solution is for ClickOnce deployment of a WPF application, the other solution for deployment of a Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. For UWP, Windows 10 is needed.

With this Chapter, code changes are not expected with the release of .NET Core. Anyway, please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.
