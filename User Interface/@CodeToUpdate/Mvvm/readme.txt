ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 31, Patterns with XAML Apps

The sample code for this chapter contains two solutions:
- MVVM
- MVVMPrism

The MVVM solution contains libraries and a WPF and a UWP application. To run the UWP application, Windows 10 is needed.
The MVVM solution contains custom libraries for the core features needed using the MVVM pattern. The MVVMPrism solution makes use of Prism.Core.

With this Chapter, code changes are not expected with the release of .NET Core. However, newer NuGet packages will be used with newer versions. Please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.
