ReadMe - Code Samples for Chapter 30, Styles and Resources

The sample code for this chapter contains two solutions:
- StylesAndResourcesUWP
- StylesAndResourcesWPF


Both of these solutions contain similar XAML styles and resources with the consideration of the differences with these technologies. To run the UWP apps, Windows 10 is needed.

With this Chapter, code changes are not expected with the release of .NET Core. Anyway, please re-check the Wrox code downloads for updates.
